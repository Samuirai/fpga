WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net btnl_btnr_OR_210_o is
   sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE
   pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      2
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   110 out of   2,278    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          313
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           140 out of     313   44%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  19 out of     313    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         154 out of     313   49%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              40 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
