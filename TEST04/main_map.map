      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   147 out of   2,278    6%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          415
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           369 out of     415   88%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of     415    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          46 out of     415   11%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              23 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
