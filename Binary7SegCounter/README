This is my first VHDL Test Project for my NEXYS3 Board from digilent with an Spartan-6
What it does:
    You can set a binary number with the switches on the board.
    The 7-Segment Display, with the 4 digits, will display this number, after counting to it.
    It can count reverse or forward, depending on the current and new number.
What I have learned:
    FPGA 100mhz clock is too fast for the signals for the 7-Segment Display. It was not possible to multiplex it.
    When I reduced the clock speed, everything worked.
    Having multiple VHDL modules and used them in a main module.

This folder includes the full 13.2 ISE Project. You can clone this and open the project.
