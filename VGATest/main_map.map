      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   2,176    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      3
      Number with same-slice register load:      0
      Number with same-slice carry load:         3
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    47 out of   2,278    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          148
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            95 out of     148   64%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   3 out of     148    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          50 out of     148   33%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              35 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
